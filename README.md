# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with PDF Uploads
This repository contains two Python scripts with a RAG application that allows users to upload PDF documents as context for the LLM to provide answers with. The applications connect open-source models from Ollama/Huggingface using the Langchain library, use Chroma as the vector database to store the information from the PDF documents, with a Streamlit user interface.
